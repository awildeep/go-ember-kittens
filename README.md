go-ember-kittens
================

Golang + EmberJS repo 


based on https://github.com/nerdyworm/ember-and-go-example

My intention is to use this repo to explore building a persistent go REST server compatible with ember-data while playing around.




Special thanks to Benjamin Rhodes for getting me started.
